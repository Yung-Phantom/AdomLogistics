/**
 * Represents a single structured entry parsed from a TXT-based database.
 * <p>
 * Each {@code TxtEntry} is identified by its {@link #entryNumber}, contains the
 * original raw lines from the TXT file in {@link #rawLines}, and exposes a parsed
 * mapping of field names to values via {@link #fields}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An entry may optionally be marked as logically deleted, indicated by the
 * {@link #deleted} flag â€” for example, when the "Status" field in the raw text equals "Deleted".

 * <ul>
 *   <li>Field data is stored in a {@code CustomHashMap} to preserve fast key lookup.</li>
 *   <li>Raw lines are stored in a {@code CustomArrayList} to retain original file order.</li>
 *   <li>This class is a data holder; parsing logic (e.g., field extraction) is performed externally.</li>
